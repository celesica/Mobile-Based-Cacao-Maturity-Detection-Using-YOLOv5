# Mobile-Based Nondestructive Identification of Cacao's Maturity Using Object Detection

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of the author's Computer Science thesis and introduces a mobile-based solution to identify the maturity of cacao pods using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm. After training, the model was exported to TensorFlow Lite to be incorporated into a mobile app.

## Features:
- Real-time detection and identification of Cacao's Maturity.
- Maturity categorization: Ripe, Unripe, and Infected.

## Development Environment:
- To be updated.

## Repository Contents:
- YOLOv5 training notebook tutorial integrated with Google Colab.
- Mobile app Android source code modified from this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AarohiSingla/TFLite-Object-Detection-Android-App-Tutorial-Using-YOLOv5/tree/main).
